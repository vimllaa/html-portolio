    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a 25 year old photographer from the south of Sweden. I started doing
      photo and videography during my travels when I worked as a flight
      attendant in 2017. Since then I have shot in many different environments
      such as weddings, landscapes, interior, portraits and more. I really enjoy
      a good adventure, beautiful settings and people. Besides my photography
      business I have a bachelor in information systems from Lund University.
